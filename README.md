# Automatic Face Detection, Cropping and Resizing for Profile Picture Production

This project consists in implementing a pipeline for automatic face detection, cropping and resizing into the given shapes for profile pictures, using Pytorch and a pre-trained Yolov7 detection model imported from WongKinYiu/yolov7 (https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7).
